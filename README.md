# hello-world
First repository - testing 
My current projects involve learning HTML and CSS, but I want to learn other types of code, such as Java Script and eventually #C. I enjoy learning, but I am less likely to sit through a class from beginning to end when I'm learning. I have to turn a problem over in my brain and learn different aspects of it at my own pace. I currently work as a technology trainer - I'm a combination teacher and tech support for my clients. I help them learn to use new peices of technology that will help them, and figure out why things aren't working the way they should. It keeps me on my toes.
